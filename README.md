# Election_Analysis

### Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate total number of cast votes.
2. Get complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Challenge Overview
It was tricky to work through the coding issues of calculating everything and making sure my variables were fully defined. Once the coding was correct tallying the results was simple. It's easy to see at a glance the important numbers and I wish Diana DeGette success with her time in office. 

### Challenge Summary
Amazing to see how small differences in the code lead to a variety of outcomes as far as printing in terminal vs printing to a summarized result sheet. The nice thing is you could use the terminal output method for occasional updates as the votes come in, then update to print or save to a sheet for the final count to announce the results.
